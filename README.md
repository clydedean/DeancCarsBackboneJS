# DeancCarsBackboneJS

Simple car showroom project using HTML/CSS/JS (Backbone.js).

## Description
A small static project that displays a list of cars and details.

## Prerequisites
- Modern web browser
- (Optional) A simple HTTP server to serve files (e.g., `live-server`)

## Install / Run
1. Open the project folder in VS Code:
   code "c:\Users\Dean Clyde\Documents\practice sir enoc\Deanc Cars"
2. Open index.html in the browser or run:
   - Using npm live-server:
     npm install -g live-server
     live-server

## Usage
- Edit files in the `css`, `img`, and `js` folders.
- Open `index.html` to view the app.
- Important: When you add a car to the product list, make sure to add the car image file into the `img/` folder as well. This project has no database and images are loaded directly from the `img` folder, so missing images will not appear.
